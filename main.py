Here are some optimizations for the Python script:

1. Remove unused imports:
```python
```

2. Optimize imports by grouping them and removing duplicates:
```python
```

3. Remove unused classes and methods to reduce complexity and improve readability.

4. Use a more descriptive name for the `TradingAssistant` class , as it performs more than just trading tasks.

5. Move the class initialization and execution code into a `main()` function as a best practice.

6. Add type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.

7. Consider using a more efficient web scraping library, such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` rather than relying on a large library like `nltk`.

8. Consider adding error handling and robustness checks to handle potential exceptions.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

Please note that these optimizations mainly focus on code organization and style. Further optimizations can be made depending on specific requirements and performance considerations.

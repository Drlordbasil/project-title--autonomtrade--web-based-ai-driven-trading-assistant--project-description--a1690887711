# AutonomTrade: Web-based AI-driven Trading Assistant

AutonomTrade is an advanced Python script that utilizes web scraping techniques and AI-driven decision-making to automate profitable trading strategies. The program utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup and Google APIs to fetch real-time data from the web, perform comprehensive analysis, and execute trades autonomously. With AutonomTrade, users can generate profits without relying on local files or traditional trading methods.

## Key Features

1. **Web Scraping:** Utilize BeautifulSoup library to extract relevant financial data from various websites, including stock prices, market news, economic indicators, and company performance metrics.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other online content to determine market sentiment. This information will be used to make intelligent trading decisions.

3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Leverage advanced algorithms to enable the AI assistant to continuously learn and adapt based on feedback and user preferences. The AI assistant will optimize trading strategies based on historical data, market trends, and user-defined criteria.

4. **Technical Analysis:** Implement various technical indicators and chart patterns to identify potential trading opportunities. The program will use algorithms to analyze historical price and volume data, identify trends, and generate buy/sell signals.

5. **Portfolio Management:** Provide users with a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and manage their investment portfolio. The AI assistant will recommend portfolio diversification strategies, risk management techniques, and constantly adjust the portfolio based on market conditions.

6. **Real-time Notifications:** Notify users of important market events, such as significant price fluctuations, news releases, or technical indicator crossovers, ensuring timely decision-making.

7. **Simulation Mode:** Enable users to test and evaluate different trading strategies in a risk-free environment using historical data. This feature allows users to validate their ideas and understand the potential outcomes before implementing them in real-time.

8. **Web-Based UI:** Develop an intuitive web-based user interface where users can access their trading dashboard, view real-time performance, configure trading settings, and monitor portfolio activity.

9. **Data Visualization:** Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly to provide interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs representing portfolio performance, trade history, and market trends.

10. **Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data and employ encryption techniques to secure all communication between the program and external APIs.
